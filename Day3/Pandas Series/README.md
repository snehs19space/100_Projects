# 📊 Pandas Series

## Overview
This guided project introduces the concept of Pandas **Series**, a fundamental one-dimensional data structure in Python used for data analysis. The project walks through various tasks such as creating Series from lists, dictionaries, and CSV files, performing operations, accessing attributes, and finally ends with a capstone project demonstrating real-world usage of Series for a financial portfolio and S&P 500 analysis.

## Tasks Breakdown

### 🔹 **Task #1: Project Introduction**
- Introduced Pandas and its primary data structures: **Series** and **DataFrame**.
- Emphasized the 1D nature of a Series (similar to a column in Excel).

### 🔹 **Task #2: Define a Pandas Series**
- Created Series using a Python list (cryptos).
- Confirmed Series type using `type()`.

### 🔹 **Task #3: Series with Custom Index**
- Created Series with **custom labels** using the `index` parameter.

### 🔹 **Task #4: Series from Dictionary**
- Converted a Python dictionary to a Pandas Series.
- Practice example included with stock tickers.

### 🔹 **Task #5: Series Attributes**
- Used:
  - `.values` to return the Series as an array.
  - `.index` for index labels.
  - `.dtype` for datatype.
  - `.is_unique` for uniqueness.
  - `.shape` for dimensions.

### 🔹 **Task #6: Series Methods**
- Applied:
  - `.sum()` for total.
  - `.product()` for multiplication.
  - `.mean()` for average.
  - `.head()` and `.tail()` to inspect subsets.
  - `.memory_usage()` to check memory consumption.

### 🔹 **Task #7: Import CSV Data**
- Imported `crypto.csv` using `pd.read_csv()`.
- Used `squeeze=True` to load as Series, `False` for DataFrame.
- Checked formatting differences between Series and DataFrame.

### 🔹 **Task #8: Built-in Functions**
- Used:
  - `len()`, `max()`, `min()` on Series.
  - `set()` to extract unique values.
  - Arithmetic with `abs()` to convert positive values to negative.

### 🔹 **Task #9: Sorting a Series**
- Used `.sort_values()` and `.sort_index()` with `inplace=True`.
- Sorted values both ascending and descending.
- Observed how sorting affects Series index.

### 🔹 **Task #10: Math Operations**
- Performed:
  - `.sum()`, `.count()`, `.mean()`, `.max()`, `.min()`, and `.describe()` to get statistical summaries.

### 🔹 **Task #11: Existence Check**
- Used:
  - `value in series.values` → Checks value existence.
  - `index in series.index` or `in series` → Checks index existence.


## 🎯 Capstone Final Project

### 🧾 Part A – Portfolio Valuation
- Created a financial portfolio using a dictionary of crypto and stock prices.
- Constructed a Series for:
  - Price
  - Quantity
- Calculated total portfolio value using `.mul()` and `.sum()`.

### 📈 Part B – S&P 500 Data Analysis
- Imported historical S&P 500 data from `S&P500_Prices.csv`.
- Converted to Series using `squeeze=True`.
- Performed:
  - `.max()`, `.min()`, `.mean()`, `.describe()`
  - `.sort_values()` and `.sort_index()`
  - Value existence check using rounding.


## Files
- `crypto.csv`: BTC-USD price data
- `S&P500_Prices.csv`: Historical S&P 500 index data


## Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** for Series creation and manipulation
- **NumPy** (implicitly)


## Key Learnings
- How to use **Pandas Series** to represent and analyze one-dimensional data.
- Difference between Series and DataFrame.
- How to import and manipulate real-world data (CSV).
- Basic financial analysis using Series.


## Conclusion
This project gives you a strong foundation in Pandas Series and shows how simple tools like `.sum()` and `.mean()` can be powerful in data analysis and decision-making, especially in finance.
